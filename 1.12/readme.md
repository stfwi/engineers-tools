## Revision history

    - v1.0.0-b3 [F] Fixed Crushing hammer experimental config flag, so it's
                    now craftable by default.

    - v1.0.0-b2 [A] Added mod internal iron and gold grit, which is used
                    if no other mod provides iron/gold dust. Can only be
                    smelted to ingots. Hidden in JEI, as the grits of
                    other mods shall be preferred.

    - v1.0.0-b1 [A] Added ore crushing hammer.
